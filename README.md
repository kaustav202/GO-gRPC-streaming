# Streaming gRPC Server

Streaming gRPC Server is designed to facilitate efficient communication between clients and servers, supporting both real-time data transmission and batch processing through streaming RPCs.

## Key Features

### Real-Time Streaming

- Support for bidirectional streaming, allowing clients and servers to send and receive messages in real-time.
- Ideal for applications requiring continuous data flow, such as live updates, notifications, and telemetry.

### Scalability

- Built to handle multiple concurrent streams, ensuring optimal performance under heavy loads.
- Supports horizontal scaling to accommodate growing user bases and data demands.

### Protocol Buffers

- Utilizes Protocol Buffers for efficient serialization and deserialization of messages, ensuring minimal latency and reduced bandwidth usage.

### Error Handling & Retries

- Implements robust error handling mechanisms, including automatic retries and backoff strategies for transient failures.
